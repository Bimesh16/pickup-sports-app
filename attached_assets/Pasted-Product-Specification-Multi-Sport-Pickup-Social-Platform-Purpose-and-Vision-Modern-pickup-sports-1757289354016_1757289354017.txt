Product Specification: Multi‑Sport Pickup & Social Platform
Purpose and Vision

Modern pickup‑sports apps like Plei and GoodRec show how technology can make it easy for casual players to find games, book facilities, and connect with other players
anadea.info
. However, current offerings tend to focus on a single sport (e.g., soccer) and often lack deep social features. The goal of this product is to provide a multi‑sport platform where users can discover, join and create pickup games for any sport while engaging with a vibrant player community through social media‑style interactions. The product combines the practical utility of scheduling and paying for games with a social feed and messaging system reminiscent of Instagram.

Target Users

Casual players looking for pickup games in their area (students, young professionals, amateur athletes).

Hosts/facility managers who organise games, provide equipment and venues, and collect payments.

Sports communities that want to create recurring leagues, events or tournaments across multiple sports.

Spectators and supporters who wish to follow players or teams and engage via comments or likes.

User Experience Workflows

Onboarding: New users register via email or social accounts, select their sports of interest, set skill level and location preferences, and follow recommended players or hosts. The app suggests nearby games and upcoming tournaments.

Discover & Join a Game: Users browse a list or map of games filtered by sport and time. Tapping a game shows details (venue, price, skill level, players attending, host reputation). Users tap “Join” to pay and reserve a spot, and can share the game with friends for joint sign‑up.

Create & Host a Game: Users with host privileges create a game by selecting sport, date/time, venue, capacity, price per player and skill level. They can set recurrence (e.g., weekly), enable waitlists and choose to auto‑approve or manually approve players. The host pays the venue fee or enables split payments; the game appears in the discovery list.

Social Interaction: After games, players can post photos/videos, tag fellow players and add captions. Friends and followers like and comment. Users can send private messages, start group chats or follow new players they enjoyed playing with. Hosts can send updates or feedback requests via chat.

Venue Management: Facility managers sign up to list their venues, set prices and manage availability. They use the admin portal to accept reservations, view analytics and manage payments. Players rate venues and leave reviews.

Notifications & Reminders: Users receive notifications when invited to games, when games are approaching, when games are updated or cancelled, and when someone interacts with their social posts. The app supports push notifications and email summaries.

Technical Considerations

Cross‑platform: Mobile apps for iOS and Android built with React Native or Flutter to ensure consistent UI and performance. Consider a Progressive Web App (PWA) for desktop access.

Backend: RESTful API with GraphQL support for efficient queries. Microservices to handle user management, game scheduling, payments, social feed, chat and analytics separately. Real‑time communication via WebSockets for messaging and live updates.

Payment integration: Support multiple payment providers (Stripe, PayPal, local wallets) and escrow to hold funds until game completion. Support refundable cancellations with conditions.

Database: Use relational database (e.g., PostgreSQL) for core data and NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB) for social feed and messaging. Geospatial indexing for location queries.

AI & recommendations: Use machine learning to recommend games and friends; analyse players’ preferences, attendance patterns and feedback.

Security & privacy: Implement JWT‑based authentication, encrypted payment data, GDPR‑compliant user data handling and consent for data collection.

Future Enhancements

Wearable integration: Connect with smartwatches or fitness trackers to import activity data and use it to personalise recommendations.

Performance analytics: Track player performance (e.g., goals scored, time played) and provide insights. Could integrate with sensors or manual input.

Livestream & highlights: Enable players to stream games via mobile camera and share highlights automatically to their feed.

NFT/Token incentives: Introduce token rewards for participation or achievements that can be redeemed for discounts on field bookings or merchandise.
