Authentication & Onboarding Prompt: “Design an elegant authentication flow: Welcome screen: Full‑screen Himalayan gradient with softly animated sunrays and a greeting (‘Namaste!’). Include a language selector (English/Nepali) and a ‘Continue’ button with a pulse micro‑animation. Login screen: Use frosted‑glass panels for input fields and pill‑shaped buttons. Show/hide password toggle and passwordless login options (e.g., biometric if enabled). On submit, call POST /auth/login and show success/failure states. Sign‑up flow: Multi‑step wizard with animated progress bar. Step 1 collects username/password (with strength meter and micro‑hint animations). Step 2 asks for preferred sport, skill level, location and nationality (dropdown with flags). Step 3 captures birthdate/gender. Each step uses soft edges, transparent overlays and culturally themed icons. On completion, call POST /users/register. Forgot password: Minimal screen with an animated envelope; calls POST /auth/forgot then POST /auth/reset when the user enters a token. Include fluid transitions and local language hints. Ensure adaptive dark mode and subtle neubrutalist shadows for all forms fuselabcreative.com .” 🧭 3. Navigation & Micro‑Interactions Prompt: “Implement a bottom tab navigator with pill‑shaped tabs and mild 3D shadows.
